# AI-Based Pest Detection and decsion support system for precision Agriculture #

##  Abstract ##

Early detection of crop pests is critical for ensuring food security and sustainable agricultural practices. This project proposes an AI-driven system that integrates deep learning-based pest classification with a rule-based decision support mechanism to assist farmers in timely and effective pest management.

The system leverages convolutional neural networks and transfer learning to classify pest images and provides actionable recommendations based on detected pest types.
